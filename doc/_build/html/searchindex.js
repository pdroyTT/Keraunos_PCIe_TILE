facilitate the coverage report to transition from a Failed state to an In Progress\nstate.\n7.1.3\nFunctional Coverage Calculation\nThe report presents two coverage metrics: Reviewed Coverage and Tested Coverage.\nReviewed Coverage gives an indication of the level of coverage for the collection of coverage objects except\nthose that have an exemption (including the exemption Untested Unsafe). Once this metric achieves full\ncoverage, the functional coverage report will have the In Progress state.\nTested Coverage gives an indication of the level of coverage for the collection of coverage objects except those\nthat have an exemption (excluding the exemption Untested Unsafe).

It is a metric for the coverage of a feature. The overall\ncoverage number of a covergroup is representing how well all features have been covered. Each feature can\nbe more or less covered. The coverage of a coverpoint is calculated as:\nwhere:\n\uf06c\n|bins| is the cardinality of the set of bins defined.\n\uf06c\n|binscovered| is the cardinality of the covered bins: the subset of all (defined) bins that are covered.\nA coverbin determines how a feature should be measured.

It is\npossible to limit their function to have the control registers for these components modeled and leave\nthe behavior out. However, if performance analysis of the software is required, then the functional\nbehavior of caches and the memory subsystem should be present to be able to see the timing\nimpact of the different data accesses by software.
