facilitate the coverage report to transition from a Failed state to an In Progress\nstate.\n7.1.3\nFunctional Coverage Calculation\nThe report presents two coverage metrics: Reviewed Coverage and Tested Coverage.\nReviewed Coverage gives an indication of the level of coverage for the collection of coverage objects except\nthose that have an exemption (including the exemption Untested Unsafe). Once this metric achieves full\ncoverage, the functional coverage report will have the In Progress state.\nTested Coverage gives an indication of the level of coverage for the collection of coverage objects except those\nthat have an exemption (excluding the exemption Untested Unsafe). Once this metric achieves full coverage,\nthe functional coverage report will have the Pass state.\nFunctional coverage is calculated as follows:\nwhere:\n\uf06c\ni is\n/set of coverage items (coverage points) defined in the coverage group.\n\uf06c\nWi is the weight associated with item i (see set_weight).\n\uf06c\nCi is the coverage of item i.\nA coverpoint typically refers to a feature to be covered. It is a metric for the coverage of a feature. The overall\ncoverage number of a covergroup is representing how well all features have been covered. Each feature can\nbe more or less covered. The coverage of a coverpoint is calculated as:\nwhere:\n\uf06c\n|bins| is the cardinality of the set of bins defined.\n\uf06c\n|binscovered| is the cardinality of the covered bins: the subset of all (defined) bins that are covered.\nA coverbin determines how a feature should be measured.
